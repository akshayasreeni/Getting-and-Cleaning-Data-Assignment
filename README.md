# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

## List of Files 

CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R - contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. 

The output of the 5th step (getting the second, independent tidy data set) is called secTidySet.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
